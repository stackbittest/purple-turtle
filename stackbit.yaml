    folder: 'basic' # Needed to match the pages to models, for READING content https://www.stackbit.com/docs/stackbit-yaml/page-models/#page_model_matching_properties
    filePath: 'basic/{slug}.md' # Fully qualify because nothing to do w/ "folder".  This is for WRITING new pages.
    urlPath: '/{slug}' # This is for WRITING new pages (and also for read).  Not necessary if URL is obvious from file, if doesn't match folder structure, etc.  Problem:  if you try to use a different token than you used in "filePath", you get "lorem-ipsum" for the non-filePath token, which, as a URL, confounds the SSG & consequently Studio, too.  So, basically, Studio doesn't support using more than 1 variable at a time in your filepath/URL, or using a different variable in your filepath/URL, since it only gives you 1 "New page path" data entry field upon new-record-creation.  (That said, they're working on making it prompt you for all required fields in the form, so don't worry about this for long.)
